 * Persistent members of type Option[T] must to be annotated with

 * since int Option[T], the type of T is erased (JVM type erasure).
 * When not present, an exception will be thrown at Table instantiation time.
 * For this reason it is a good practice that all Tables be instantiated at
 * bootstrap time, which is the case if all Tables are declared as members of
 * a singleton org.squeryl.Schema
